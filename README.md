#### _This Portfolio is a brief overview showcasing some of the HTML and CSS skills that I have learned at Epicodus, 05.13.18_

## _My portfolio highlights both bootstrap and custom styling in CSS, a few pieces of inline styling (span, em, and strong), and several other HTML tags. I typically don't struggle linking folders and sub-folders (like CSS/IMG folders), but for some reason I had a difficult time linking those correctly - I might have to practice or change my settings._
